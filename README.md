# IRL-Protocol
IRL protocol for NFTs

IRL protocol. A vault for your NFTs that let's you delegate a signer for offline verification

This project enables a user to deposit NFTs into a vault. Users can then delegate an address that can sign to prove ownership of the NFT in an offline way. The vault  has a built in directory to lookup the delegated owner of any nft in the vault. When a user withdraws an NFT the delegate is deleted. This application enables the ability to securely use your NFT for access without needing to worry about bringing hot keys with you that could be stolen. Future versions will have a marketplace for renting NFTs for special events in a secure and decentralized way



alpha version deployed on MATIC mainet (experimental no audit conducted yet):
